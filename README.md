# Maths
 Old old old maths projects I did investigating Prime numbers and Square Triangular numbers

This repository consists of a couple of scripts I wrote for generating Prime numbers and generating Square Triangular numbers

### Prime Numbers

In this folder there are 3 other folders:

	- Primes Original
	- Primes v2
	- Uncertain Purpose Primes

Primes Original & Primes v2 script generate primes and store them in a txt file called "Prime_file"

The Uncertain Purpose Primes are scripts that I'm sure do something, buts its been so long that I can't remember what.
